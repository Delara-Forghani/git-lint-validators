This project is designed to ensure that the commits you're making to a
repository follow the git coding style. This is simply the basic
validators.

The standard that they test for is [the one described by Chris Beams].

The validations it implements are:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters (soft limit, hard limit at 69)
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Wrap the body at 72 characters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisities

You'll need to install:

 * PHP (Minimum 7.0)

### Installing

```bash
composer require --dev PurpleBooth/git-lint-validators
```

## Usage

### Tool

You can try out this library by using it as a [git commit hook].

[git commit hook]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks

#### Git hook installation

Use the `install-git-hook` Composer script to install the hook. An existing hook is
backed to `.git/hooks/commit-msg.bak`.

```bash
composer install-git-hook
```

It's fairly customisable too, here are some options:

```
$ vendor/bin/git-lint-validators help git-lint-validator:hook
Usage:
  git-lint-validator:hook [options] [--] <commit-message-file>

Arguments:
  commit-message-file                Path to commit message file

Options:
  -i, --ignore[=IGNORE]              Ignore a commit message that matches this pattern and don't test it [default: ["/^Merge branch/"]] (multiple values allowed)
  -c, --comment-char[=COMMENT-CHAR]  Ignore lines that are prefixed with this character [default: "#"]
  -h, --help                         Display this help message
  -q, --quiet                        Do not output any message
  -V, --version                      Display this application version
      --ansi                         Force ANSI output
      --no-ansi                      Disable ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction               Do not ask any interactive question
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose               Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Help:
 Check your commit messages to ensure they follow the guidelines
 in your add this to your .git/hooks/commit-msg file


 Here are some good articles on commit message style:

 * http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
 * https://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#Commit-Guidelines
 * https://github.com/blog/926-shiny-new-commit-styles


```

#### Output While Running

```

$ git commit


 [ERROR] Incorrectly formatted commit message


 * Please limit the body line length of the commit message to 72 characters (http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)

Your Commit Message
-------------------

 Add commit message to output of hook

 It can be frustrating if you've lost a large git commit message because it
 doesn't match the style guide. This will add a little message including
 your commit details
 # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
 # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
 # On branch added-original-commit-message-to-hook
 # Changes to be committed:
 #	modified:   src/PurpleBooth/GitLintValidators/Command/Hook.php
 #



 [WARNING] A commit has not been created

```

### Library

You can use the whole library

```php
<?php

$validatorFactory = new ValidatorFactoryImplementation();
$validators       = $validatorFactory->getMessageValidator();

$message
    = <<<MESSAGE
This is an example title

This is a message body. This is another part of the body.
MESSAGE;

$exampleMessage = new MessageImplementation("exampleSha", $message);

$validators->validate($exampleMessage);
// -> Message Object will now have a Status objects set on them
```

Alternatively you could use the validators alone

```php
<?php

new ValidateMessageImplementation(
    [
        new CapitalizeTheSubjectLineValidator(),
        new DoNotEndTheSubjectLineWithAPeriodValidator(),
    ]
);

$message
    = <<<MESSAGE
This is an example title

This is a message body. This is another part of the body.
MESSAGE;

$exampleMessage = new MessageImplementation("exampleSha", $message);

$messageValidator->validate($exampleMessage);
// -> Message Object will now have a Status objects set on them
```

Please depend on the interfaces rather than the concrete
implementations. Concrete implementations may change without causing a
BC break, interfaces changing will cause major version increment,
indicating a BC break.

## Running the tests

First checkout the library, then run

```bash
composer install
```

### Coding Style

We follow PSR2, and also enforce PHPDocs on all functions. To run the tests for coding style violations

```bash
vendor/bin/phpcs -p --standard=psr2 src/
```

### Unit tests

We use PHPSpec for unit tests. To run the unit tests

```bash
vendor/bin/phpspec run
```
